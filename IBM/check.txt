It was 1992, and a I visited a friend, he was doing something on his computer and I asked what it was. This is when he showed me his BBS. This friend was Baldman (Nigel Howe) and his BBS was called "The Hairless BBS" running MAXBoard. Needless to say I was fascinated, so much so that I picked up the trade and exchange, found the necessary things over the next feew weeks and started exploring Auckland's BBS land, at the time I was armed with an IBM compatible "Commodore 486sx/25 complete with Telix and my external 2400 baud modem.
